<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
	School publications are important for the students to be well-informed and updated to crucial institutional updates and happenings, social issues and alike. Since then,  the most common concern of these organizations is how to cope with the rising demand for innovation and technology. It is their primary goal to deliver the bits of information to the student body using more efficient and accessible way. The best solution for a paperless publication is the development a system that makes writing, editing, posting and publishing of articles easy, fast, and organized.</p>
	<p>The LATHE Group of Student Publications, the official student publication of Batangas State University is an organization that still on the traditional process of publication—articles are being printed in five editions namely The LATHE Newsletter, Ang LALIK (Tabloid), Sensus Communis (Magazine), Literary Folio, and the LATHE Art Compilation. Thus, this project aimed to develop a web application that will automate the traditional process of publication for the LATHE.</p>

<h1>Scopes</h1>
<p>
	This project aims to develop a web-based application that can post, edit and publish news article online using the concept of Data Structures and Algorithm. The project deals with different data structures such as a one-dimensional and multi-dimensional array. It also implements the use of an algorithm for faster processing and to handle run-time errors effectively. This will use Python as its backend, Bootstrap as its frontend, and MySQL as its database. </p>
	<p>The system is composed of three primary modules, one is for the page administrator to control the posting of articles, one for the system administrator that is used to control the users and the sections of articles, and the other one serves as the reading platform for the readers. Below is the  detailed description of the system’s module:<p>
  <ul>
  <li>
<i>System Administration Module</i>
   <p> In this module, the user can control the staffers' account. This can add, edit, and disable/enable user.  Also, this module can add, edit, and delete article sections. To be able to access this module, the user needs to login using the system password/code.  This module is designed to be used by the adviser/director of the publication or the ICT office of the university. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
<i>Page Administration Module</i>
<p>
    This module is primarily designed for the LATHE staffers. There are two primary roles in this module, one is the editor and the writer. The editor role has the full access and control to the articles. It can write, edit and publish articles to the reading platform. On the other hand, the writer has limited capability. It can only write articles and save them as a draft. Another feature of the system is the ability of the staffers to post notes in the article for better communication between the editor and writer.  The system can easily post articles with desired formatting and images.
